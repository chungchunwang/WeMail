# WeMail - WeChat in your inbox. 
## What is this?
This is a tool that sends all of the WeChat messages you recieve as emails. 
## Why?
Personally, I just made this for fun to try out the capabilities of Wechaty.
But these might be some use cases:
- You are at an institution where WeChat is prohibited.
- You want to get off your phone all the time but still want to get information from others.
- You want to keep a permanent record of all your messages in email form.
## Setup
Prerequisites: You will need Node.js on your system.

1. Pull this repository, and run `npm install`.
2. Go into settings.js and fill in the corresponding information for your email.
3. Run `npm start`. To start the program.
4. Scan the QR Code generated and login with WeChat.
5. Volia! It should now work.
